# EEDemo

Manual test cases and test plan: EEFunctionalTest.txt

Automation done against those scenarios. 

What I'd do differently if I took more time... :)
1. Add error catching
2. Add logging (using Nlog), so that errors get logged to:
  a. local drive
  b. database / kibana
3. Keep element references in a single location (tidier code)
